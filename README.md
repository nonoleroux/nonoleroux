### Hello World ! 👋

- 🔭&nbsp;&nbsp;Who am I ? I’m a soon-to-be Junior Software Developer who studied for 21 months at Ada Tech School: a school that "breaks the codes" (pun intended 😉 ) based on "learning by doing" and "Montessori" educational methods.

- 💻&nbsp;&nbsp;How did the school work ? We learnt how to build programs using several languages, depending on the project we were working on as a team for 9 months and then worked in a company as an apprentice for 12 months on a basis of 4 days @ the company and 1 day @ school.

- 📷&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a snapshot of what I've been working on during the 9 months course:
    * **Javascript, HTML, CSS** for a web extension project, for a data vizualisation project etc.,
    * **Ruby** for a chatbot project, displaying recipes based on the ingredients you have in your fridge, a shifumi game project etc.,
    * **PHP (with Laravel Framework), SQL, HML, CSS** for a mock social network project : we had to manage connexions, comments, followers, like buttons etc.,
    * **Asynchronous programming in JS and NodeJS** used to create a mini server with promises, callbacks, events, etc.,
    * **Oriented Object Programming in JS (React) and Python** used to create a "low tech blog" using classes, inheritance etc.,
    
    => For more details, feel free to check the projects down below ⬇️
    
- 📷&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a second snapshot of what I've been working on during my 12 months apprenticeship:
    * **Typescript/React** coding and refactoring components from the Design System as part of a DevOps Team.
    * **NodeJS** coding for a media server/media center - an internal tool of the company - as part of a DevOps Team.
    * **Typescript/React** coding pages on the main website on the Front side as part of a FT Team.
