### Hello World ! 👋

- 🔭&nbsp;&nbsp;Who am I ? I’m a Software Developer student at Ada Tech School: a school that "breaks the codes" (pun intended 😉 ) based on "learning by doing" and "Montessori" educational methods.

- 💻&nbsp;&nbsp;How does it work ? We are learning how to build programs using several languages, depending on the project we are working on as a team.

- 📷&nbsp;&nbsp;More precisely ? Here is a snapshot of what I've been working on in the past few months:
    * **Javascript, HTML, CSS** for a web extension project, for a data vizualisation project etc.,
    * **Ruby** for a chatbot project, displaying recipes based on the ingredients you have in your fridge, a shifumi game project etc.,
    * **PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS** for a mock social network project : we had to manage connexions, comments, followers, like buttons etc.,
    * **Lua** for a PICO-8 game : we had to manage graphism, collisions, interactions etc.,
    * **APIs** used in another chatbot project to display movies based on your preferences etc., 
    * **Asynchronous programming in JS and NodeJS** used to create a mini server with promises, callbacks, events, etc.,
    * **Oriented Object Programming in JS and Python** used to create a "low tech blog" using classes, inheritance etc.,
    
    => For more details, feel free to check the projects down below ⬇️
    
- 🔎&nbsp;&nbsp;What am I looking for ? An **apprenticeship (June 2021)** where I could be of use, of course, but more importantly where I could continue learning and participate to the development of a company by collaborating on challenging projects!
